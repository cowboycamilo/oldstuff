msi2lmp tool documentation

IMPORTANT Note:

Two forcefield files, cvff.frc and cff91.frc, are needed to generate
LAMMPS data files from MSI output.  We do not distribute these files
with LAMMPS because Accelys (nee MSI/BioSym) sells them as part of
their molecular modeling packages.  If you are using the msi2lmp tool,
presumably you already have these Accelys files on your system.  You
should place copies of the 2 files in this directory.

The files included in the directory are as follows:

 - This README

 - Msi2LMP2.h -- Contains #includes, global variables, and definition of 
		 two data structures, the first contains information from 
		 each atom and the second  
		 contains information for each forcefield term.

 - Forcefield.h -- Contains the definition of the forcefield data structures

 - Msi2LMP2.c -- Process command line options and requests further info,
	         Contains main()
		 Calls ReadCarFile(), and ReadMdfFile() to fill atom structures
                 Calls ReadFrcFile() to read .frc file into memory
 		 Calls MakeLists() and ReadCoefficients() to fill BondList
			structures
		 Calls BuildLMP() to create LAMMPS input file and write data
			to it.
                 Calls CreateOutputReport to create a report file

 - FrcMenu.c -- Menu function for prompting user for input if they did
		not specify a forcefield in the command line

 - ReadCarFile.c -- From original Msi2LMP.  Allocates memory for data
                 	based on number of atoms and fills position info
          		from .car file into data structure.
		    Only change is atom number is assigned to
		       data strucure atoms[k].no

 - ReadMdfFile.c -- Reads connectivity info into atoms data structure
		    also updates charge parameter.  Calls LinkConnections.c
		    to match connections names with numbers.

- LinkConnections.c -- Matches connection names to the number of the 
		       corresponding atom.

- ReadFrcFile.c -- Reads the forcefield coefficients into memory

- InitializeItems.c -- Initializes data items in forcefield structures
		       (i.e. number of members, number of parameters)

- SearchAndFill.c -- Function that searches for each forcefield item and
                     fills in parameters for each item

- MakeLists.c -- Fills in the BondList structures by determining bonds,
		 angles, torsions, and oops.  Reduces 'types' into 'a',
		 assigning only unique types to 'a'.  Searches .frc
		 file for equivalece potentials.  For class 2, the 
		 cross terms are generated.

- ReadCoefficientsF1.c   -- Reads coefficients from the forcefield data and 
  ReadCoefficientsF2.c	    stores them in the 'param' item of the BondList 
			    structure. F1 is for class I and F2 for class 2

 - SearchDynamicFrc.c -- Searches the forcefield data structures to match
			 parameters to data. 

 - BuildLMP.c -- Creates data.root output file and writes appropriate data

 - CreateOutputReport - Creates report.root which prints all the parameters
			assigned 

 - Makefile -- the file defining parameters for the make utility

 - Data directory -- sample .car and .mdf data files
