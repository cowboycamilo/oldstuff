.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAup
calculates the thermodynamics of RNA-RNA interactions. RNA-RNA
binding is decomposed into two stages. (1) First the probability
that a sequence interval (e.g. a binding site) remains unpaired is
computed. (2) Then the binding energy given that the binding site is
unpaired is calculated as the optimum over all possible types of bindings.   

.br
RNAup provides two different modes: By default only the probability of
being unpaired and the free energy to open a region of length -u are
plotted to a file. The region of minimal free energy of unfolding is written
to stdout.

.br
In interaction mode interaction between two RNAs is calculated. It is
invoked if two sequences seperated by "&" are given. By default the longer
RNA is considered a structured target sequence, the shorter one an
unstructured small RNA. The structure of the small RNA can be included
using the -b option. 
.br
In this mode additionally the conditional probability of an
interaction and the optimal free energy of binding at a given position are
plotted to a file. 
Output to stdout consists of the optimal structure upon hybridization
(using RNAduplex), the location and the free energy, dG, for the 
region of minimal free  energy of interaction. (where dG = dGint + dGu_l;
dGint: free energy of interaction, dGu_l: free energy necessary to open the
longer sequence).  

.br
(Notice:
The output to stdout is dG[i,j;k,l], where position i<j are in the longer
sequence and positions k<l are in the shorter sequence. dG[i,j;k,l] is the
largest contribution to dG[i,j] = sum_kl dG[i,j;k,l] which is given in the
output file: therefore dG[i,j;k,l] <= dG[i,j].) 
.br

Each sequence should be in 5' to 3' direction. If the sequence is preceded
by a line of the form 
.br 
> name
.br
the output file "name_up.out" is produced. Otherwise the file name
defaults to RNA_up.out. Existing files of the same name will be
overwritten. 
.br

RNA sequences are read from stdin as strings of characters, white space and
newline within a sequence cause an error. Newline is used to separate
sequences. The program will continue to read new sequences until a line
consisting of the single character @ or an end of file condition is
encountered. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.B Options for probability of an unpaired region:
.TP
.B \-u \fIlen\fP
specifies the length (len) of the unstructured region in the output. The
default value is 4. The probability of being unpaired is plotted on the
right border of the unpaired region. You can specify up to 20
different length values:  use "-" to specify a range of continuous values (e.g. -u 4-8) or specify a list of comma separated values (e.g. -u 4,8,15).
.TP
.B \-c \fI"SHIME"\fP
by default only the full probability of being unpaired is
plotted. The -c option allows to get the different contributions (c) to the
probability of being unpaired: The full probability of being unpaired ("S")
is the sum of the probability of being unpaired in the exterior loop
("E"), within a hairpin loop ("H"), within an interior loop ("I") and within a
multiloop ("M"). Any combination of these letters may be given.
.TP
.B Options for calculation of interaction:
.TP
.B \-w \fIlen\fP
determines the maximal length of the region of interaction, the default 
is 25. 
.TP
.B \-b 
include the probability of unpaired regions in both (b) RNAs. By default
only the probability of being unpaired in the longer RNA (target) is used.
.TP 
.B \-5(\-3) \fIlen\fP
These options extend the region of interaction in the target by len 
residues to the 5' and 3' side, respectively. The underlying assumption is 
that it is favorable for an interaction if not only the direct region of 
contact is unpaired but also a few residues 5'and 3' of this region. 
.TP
.B \-Xp
set interaction mode. Pairwise (p) interaction is calculated: The first
sequence interacts with the 2nd, the third with the 4th etc. If -Xp is
selected two interacting sequences may be given in a single line
separated by "&" or each sequence may be given on an extra line.
.TP
.B \-Xf
set interaction mode. The interaction of each sequence with the first
one is calculated (e.g. interaction of one mRNA with many small RNAs). Each
sequence has to be given on an extra line.
.TP
.B general options:
.TP
.B \-C
Calculate structures subject to constraints. Symbols ".", "x" and
the matching brackets "( )" work in boths modes as described in
\fBRNAfold\fP. Symbols "<" and ">" are soley used for the calculation of
unpaired regions. The "|" constrain works only in interaction mode, the
corresponding base has to be paired intermolecularily.

.PP
the \-noGU, \-noCloseGU, \-nsp, \-S, \-P, \-noLP, \-T, \-4, and \-d 
options work as in \fBRNAfold\fP, see there for description.
