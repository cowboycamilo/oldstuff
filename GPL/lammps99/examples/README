The test and benchmarking inputs are in several directories.  Each
test case has an input script (in.*), an input data file (data.*), a
sample parameter file that could be used to compile the code
(param.*), and sample outputs (log.*).  The suffix on the outputs
represents the machine type and # of processors it was run on.

lj		2048-atom runs of a monomeric and ternary LJ mixture
			using NVE, NVT, NPT ensembles,
			data files were created using tools/setup_lj.f
charge		512 charged atoms, couple of timesteps to test
			Coulombic cutoff, Ewald, PPPM
class2		small molecule with class II force fields
min		small molecule minimization
lc		small and large version of liquid crystal molecular
			simulation, tests periodic and non-periodic,
			class I force fields, cutoffs, Ewald, PPPM
flow		2-d LJ system with various constraints and temperature
			creation options to model flow thru a channel
polymer		bead-spring polymer models of 16 50-mer chains, system
			a is all the same type chain, system ab has
			2 types of chains with different diameter	
			monomers and also includes a few free monomers,
			the data files were created from the def files
			using tools/setup_chain.f
