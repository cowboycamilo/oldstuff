	* scallop.prj: configure.ac: Fixed order of kelp libraries

2002-05-10  Greg Balls  <gballs@sdsc.edu>

        This project was placed under prcs control some time ago.  I
	noticed today that prcs.el was modifying this file automatically
	and making things ugly.  So I turned that option off.  Full change
	logs are still available through prcs.  This file will contain only
	public-release level changelogs from now on, though.

	This is the first distribution of the code.  Not much in the way
	of a changelog yet.
