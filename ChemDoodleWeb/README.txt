ChemDoodle Web Components

ChemDoodle Web Components are pure javascript objects derived from
ChemDoodle (www.ChemDoodle.com) to solve common chemistry related
tasks on the web. These components are powerful, fully customizable,
easy to implement, work on all major browsers, and are free under
the GPL Version 3 license.

See the PHP web page files in the samples directory for examples
of how to use the components on your website.

A few things to keep in mind:
- In order to use the components, you must use a recent browser.
  Specifically, Safari 4, Firefox 3.5, Google Chrome 2+, or Internet
  Explorer 6+. Opera does not yet fully support the canvas tag.
- The canvas tag of these browsers can be CPU intensive. So performance
  may vary depending on the CPU and memory available on your computer.
- The ChemDoodleWeb PHP scripts are provided as examples only. They are not
  meant to be used in a production application to access a production database.
  It is up to the user to make it robust and secure.
