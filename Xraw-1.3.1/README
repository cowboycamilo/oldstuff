                     The Remake of The Athena Widget Set

                                 version 1.3.1
________________________________________________________________________

  The Xraw is a result of evolution well-known Athena Widget Set 
(called as Xaw; author Chris D. Reterson formerly MIT X Consortium) during
development X Window version of the LEaP molecular graphics program in
the AMBER Project at Peter Kollman's lab at the University of California,
San Francisco.

  The main goal of this work was to update GUI and approach main public 
domain widget set as Xaw is toward to OSF/Motif.

  Some new widgets were created (Table, ScrolledTable, Frame etc..).
  
  Xraw is compatible with R4 and R5.  
It compiles cleanly on a SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.4, HPUX A.09.05.

  You can find docs for this set on:

__Notes_________________________________________________________________

  Docs not for all widget have been made yet (ask me what you need for)..

  There is not warranty for full compatibility with Xaw..

  If you have an idea of new widget, drop me two lines..
