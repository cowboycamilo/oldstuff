=====================================================================

This program is a general purpose molecular dynamics code for simulations
of mixtures  of either rigid or flexible molecules, interacting by
AMBER-like force field in a periodic rectangular cell. In the case of 
flexible molecules the double time step algorithm is used.
Algotithms for NVE, NVT and NPT are employed, as well
as optimized Ewald sum for treatment of the electrostatic interactions. 
The program can be run both in sequential and parallel execution, in
the latter case the MPI parallel environment is required.
